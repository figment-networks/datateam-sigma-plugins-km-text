# Sigma Plugins - KM Text

## Summary

Sigma allows third-party applications to be used in its product as plugins, which interact with Sigma's plugin API to render worksheet data in visualizations that aren't otherwise available in Sigma's standard suite of UI elements (which are somewhat limited, especially when compared to JS libraries like ChartJS, Highcharts, and Apex). Sigma has additional documentation on its architecture for plugins [here](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410322911123-Develop-Sigma-Plugins).
